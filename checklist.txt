Week 8 - Weekend Challenge - Server Calculator

-Getting Set up(files)
Server - server.js [X]
    -Public - index.html [X]
        Scripts - client.js [X]
        Styles - style.css [X]
        Vendors - jquery.js [X]

[X] - .gitignore
[X] - Install Express
[X] - Install Body-Parser

Create a user interface where the user can input two values (2 input elements)
and the select type of mathematical operation. 
[X]Create buttons for +,-,*,and /
[X]Create functions to take values from inputs and carry out desired operations
    [X]Add Values
    [X]Subtract Values
    [X]Multiply Values
    [X]Divide Values

[X]Create '=' button and C button
[ ]Create functions to carry out button operations
    [ ](=button).on('.clicked',functions to send answers to server via POST)
    [ ]('#clearBtn').on('.clicked', clear user input fields)

[ ]When the submit (`=` button) is clicked, 
[ ]capture this input, 
[ ]bundle it up in an object, 
[ ]and send this object to the server via a POST. 

[ ]There should also be a 'C' button that will clear the user input fields.

Build out the server-side logic to compute the numbers as appropriate. 
The server should be able to handle Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. 
Once the calculation is complete, send back the OK. 
You should do a GET request after the POST to get the actual calculation.

### History

Keep a historical record of all math operations and solutions on the server. 
Display a list of all previous calculations on the page when it loads using a GET request. 
Update the list when a new calculation is made.

> NOTE: History should exist even after refreshing the page. 
It's expected that the history will go away after restarting the server. 
We'll talk about long term data storage next week.
